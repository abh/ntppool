Hi,

42Networks manufactures VoIP-enabled SoHo/SMB type switches and
routers. We use NTP in our products to get time information for
various functions, not least caller id info.

We would like to consider using the NTP pool as our default mechanism
to define which NTP servers to use (customers do then have the option
to define their own NTP servers, usually our customers are network or
voice operators who have their own NTP servers).

Per the pool.ntp.org website, I'd like to investigate whether we can
get one or more vendor-specific hostnames for our use. We produce
approximately 100k units per annum, and have approx 200k units in the
field (which would be upgraded to use the new hostname). Most of our
customers are in Europe, but we have increasing sales in Asia too.

Thanks, regards,
Charles
