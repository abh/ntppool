Hi,

I sent you an email yesterday asking for a vendor zone but because of  
a mail server failure my mail might have been lost or I might have  
lost your reply.
Mi company produces videocommunication devices. We would like to use  
the pool ntp services on our devices.
We plan to deliver 1000 unit within one year.
We would also like to join the pool with our ntp server.

As our company name is tvblob the zone name tvblob would be appropriate.

One question: is authentication supported by the pool?

Thanks
Rodolfo
