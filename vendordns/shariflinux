Hi.

I was just reading your FTP pool for vendors document,
http://www.pool.ntp.org/vendors.html

Apparently, we need to ask for a pool.ntp.org hostname for our product.
We are using fedora.pool.ntp.org at the moment, but will push the new
NTP server details in updates and the next version of the product.

This is for use in Sharif Linux, our Fedora-based GNU/Linux distribution
customized for the Iranian market. We can't easily predict the number of
NTP users as it's not the default option and the CDs can be legally
copied by a user, but my rough estimate of Sharif Linux users of NTP in
the next year is under 3000 machines.

Thanks a lot,
