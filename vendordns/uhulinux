        Subject:        ntp vendor zone for UHU-Linux

Dear admins,

I'm writing to you as a developer of a Hungarian Linux distribution called
"UHU-Linux". We launch isc ntpd by default (currently version 4.2.0) and so
far we had several fixed IPs in our default config. Now I see that it's the
wrong approach so I'd like to as you to set up a vendor zone for us. The
preferred domain name would be *.uhulinux.pool.ntp.org if possible. Our
guess for the number of users is somewhere between 10.000 and 100.000, and
since our distro is focused on supporting the Hungarian language, most of
the machines running UHU-Linux are physically located in Hungary or near
Hungary, so if possible, time servers from this region would be preferred.

In the mean time, we have 2 servers with fixed IP addresses located at
different ISPs, so most likely I'll set up a public ntp server on them and
join the pool.


Thanks very much:

Egmont
