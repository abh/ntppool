Subject:        Vendor zone setup

Dear sir,

We are a start-up company just about to ship our first product, a  
network appliance for WLAN that has a configuration option for NTP.
After some research, I would like to explore the possibility of  
setting up a vendor zone with pool.ntp.org. The purpose is, as stated  
on the pool.ntp.org's website, to provide NTP setup default for our  
customer.

The estimated number of system we will be shipping is less then 1,000  
for the first year. Please let me know what is involved and what do I  
need to do next to have the zone setup.

Regards,
TK Wang
