RT#811 - http://rt.develooper.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=811

Dear NTP pool team.
I'm Peter Heumann, project manager for Digital Home accessory devices  
in the R&D department of Fujitsu Siemens Computers.

We are currently developing a range of products that will incorporate  
time syncronizing functions using NTP client services. In order to  
make configuration and use of time syncronization easy for our  
customers, we would like to use the NTP pool service that you are  
offering.

The volume of untis affected by this would be between 10 000 and 100  
000 units after several years, starting with around 10 000 over the  
next months.

Please let me know if it is possible to set up a vendor pool address  
(preferably fsc.pool.ntp.org) and please let me know the terms and  
conditions for use.

Looking forward to receiving your feedback.

Thanks a lot.
Best regards
