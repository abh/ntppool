Hi.  I was reading your page at http://www.pool.ntp.org/vendors.html,  
and
then wondering how to set up an Intel vendor zone (or if there exists  
one
already)?

Usage estimate, at least for now, is < 1000 systems.  Its not for Intel
corporate machines, but rather an embedded-type box I'm developing.

Thx,
- Kevin
