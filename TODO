multi server:

  - monitor script
    - use Getopt::Long
    - return score results every N servers instead of just at the end

  - rrd files
    - graph data per monitor in addition to the total score

  - csv export
    - include monitor name


High priority things:

  * Make the combust lang= cookie be a regular cookie

  * Use Net::IP instead of Net::IPv6Addr

  * Normalize IP addresses before they are added (and make a one-time
    script to go through and normalize old ones)


After that then some of the things I have on my list are (not necessarily in order of priority)

  * Improve the scoring mechanism to better track long term stability
    (right now the score is basically based on your last couple of days)

  * Let people mark their server as "available to other pool members".
    Use the long term scores to include / recommend / ... servers from
    that list to new admins who want to join the pool.

   * Improve the monitoring system to have multiple monitoring stations around the world.

   * Make each monitoring station exchange information with each other and the DNS servers able to get the information from any one of them.

   * Make a system to allow translations of the pool website, ideally including the manage interface.

   * Deploy more Soekris/WRAP boxes for monitoring stations and "super nodes"

IPv6 support
  - When adding a server by name, query the AAAA record, too and offer
    to add both if applicable

allow an organization name and http link for each user for attribution
  - schema change
  - UI to update it on the manage page
  - Logic on the zone pages to show the organization url relative to
    the current total score for the user or some such

check if the servers do HTTP redirects 
  - check for request to pool.ntp.org and foo.pool.ntp.org
  - ok if redirect to www.pool.ntp.org
  - ok if none
  - warning if redirect somewhere else

update use.html page (be more explicit about number of zones)

make the country zones alias to the continent zones when they are otherwise too small

de-couple the monitoring from the database (So it can work remotely)
  - API for entering monitoring results?

Change the schema so we can support multiple monitoring systems

Make an API so the monitoring systems can pull configuration (list of
servers) and post back monitoring results via HTTP (or jabber?)

Make the monitoring servers use ntpd (noselect) to test the servers 
  - figure out the magic ntpdc commands to add and remove noselect servers
    (is that even possible?)

make server page and user profile show when the server is not in the pool (50% done)

document the growth target thing

make the country zones alias to the continent zones when they are
otherwise too small
