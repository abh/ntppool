<div class="block">

<h1>Vendor contributions</h1>

<h3>Commercial vendors</h3>
<p>
To cover the operating costs of the (volunteer run) NTP Pool Project
we ask commercial software and device vendors to pay a small fee based
on usage (typically how many clients use the service).  This makes it
possible to continue operating the service, for commercial vendors and
open source software alike.
</p>

<p>
All funds are used to run the NTP Pool Project services.
</p>

<p>
We will get in touch via the ticketing system; or if we missed it
please reply to the ticket so we can follow-up!

<h3>Open Source vendors</h3>
<p>
If you distribute a NTP implementation using the pool, you must place
a reference to the pool in the documentation and configuration files
(or configuration screen).  If your NTP implementation is a server
able to serve clients, please add a note
about <a href="http://www.ntppool.org/join.html">joining the
pool</a> to encourage server operators using your software to help out.
