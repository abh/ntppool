	<h3><a name="join">How do I join pool.ntp.org?</a></h3>
	<p>
	First: Thanks for your interest.  Usage of the pool has grown
	enormously, and the only way we can keep it easy for everyone to run a
	pool server is to also grow the number of servers participating.
	</p>

	<p>
	Your computer <b>must have a static IP address</b> and a permanent
	Internet connection.  It's very important that your IP address doesn't
	change or only does so extremely infrequently (say once a year or
	less).  The required bandwidth is relatively low.  Each client will
	only send a few UDP packets every few to every 20 minutes.
	</p>

	<p>
	Currently most servers get about 5-15 NTP packets per second
	with spikes of 60-120 packets per second a few times a day.
	This is roughly equivalent to 10-15Kbit/sec with
	spikes of 50-120Kbit/sec.  The project steadily acquires more
	timeservers, so the load should not increase dramatically for
	each server.  In plain terms, you probably need at least
	384-512Kbit bandwidth (in and out-going).
	</p>

	<p>
	The servers joining should not have <tt>pool.ntp.org</tt> as their upstream
	server(s), but should configure some <a href="https://support.ntp.org/Servers/StratumTwoTimeServers/">good servers</a> manually. Those servers
	<b>may</b> be chosen from the pool. The point is that they are chosen
	statically instead of being assigned randomly from the pool at each server
	restart.  This will help providing an acceptable quality of service.

	Note that it is not required that your server is a stratum 1 or 2
	server - as this project is about load distribution mostly, there is
	no reason why a stratum 3 or even stratum 4 server shouldn't join.
	</p>

	<p>
	We have a page with <a href="/join/configuration.html">configuration recommendations for servers joining the pool</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Finally, I must emphasize that joining the pool is a <b>long term
	commitment</b>.  We are happy to take you out of the pool again if your
	circumstances change, but because of how the NTP clients operate <b>it
	will take weeks, months or even YEARS before the traffic completely
    goes away</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
	If this is all ok, login to the
	<a href="/manage">server management</a> page and request your server to be added.
	If you have any trouble with the system, email me at <a
	href="mailto:ask@develooper.com">ask@develooper.com</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	It would be nice (but it's not necessary) if you could redirect web requests
	on port 80 of your time server to the official web page of the project at
	<tt>https://www.ntppool.org/</tt>. If you run Apache, you could do this with:
	</p>

        [% PROCESS tpl/join/virtual_host_example.html %]

	<p>
	Again, this is only if you run a webserver anyway. The official project web
	page will always be given with the 'www' at the beginning - but sometimes
	people type <tt>pool.ntp.org</tt> and are then surprised to get a random web
        page.
	</p>
	<p>
	Once added to the pool the server is constantly monitored for
        availability and precision.  You can watch your server's
        performance using the <a href="scores">web frontend</a> or
        the <a href="/manage">management page</a>.
