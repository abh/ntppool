<p>
The pool.ntp.org project is a big virtual cluster of timeservers providing reliable <a href="use.html">easy to use</a> NTP service for millions of clients.
</p>

<p>
The pool is being used by millions or tens of millions of systems around the world.  It's the default "time server" for most of the major Linux distributions and many networked appliances (see <a href="vendors.html">information for vendors</a>).
</p>

<p>
Because of the large number of users we are in need of more servers. If you have a server with a static IP address always available on the internet, please consider <a href="join.html"> adding it to the system</a>.
</p>

<p>
The project is maintained and developed by <a href="http://www.askask.com/">Ask Bj√∏rn Hansen</a> and a great group of contributors on the <a href="/mailinglists.html">mailing lists</a>. The source code for the system is <a href="http://github.com/abh/ntppool">available</a>.
</p>

<p>
Hosting and bandwidth for the "hub" servers are provided by <a href="http://develooper.com/">Develooper</a> and <a href="http://www.phyber.com/">Phyber Communications</a>.
