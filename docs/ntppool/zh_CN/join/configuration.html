<h3>Configuration recommendations for servers joining the pool</h3>

<p>
The <a href="http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/WebHome">Support
section</a> on <a href="http://support.ntp.org/">support.ntp.org</a> has a lot
of useful information.
</p>

<p>
If you just want to <i>use</i> the pool, see the <a href="/use.html">pool usage</a> page.
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.protocols.time.ntp">comp.protocols.time.ntp</a>
newsgroup is the best place to get help with the ntpd software.
</p>

<p>
Below are some things of particular importance if you are going to
join the NTP Pool with your server.
</p>

<h4 id="management-queries">Management queries</h4>

<p>Make the default configuration be to not allow "management queries". For ntpd this will be adding the "noquery" option to the default "restrict" lines, for example:</p>

[% INCLUDE "join/configuration/restrict-default.html" %]

<p>To allow commands like "ntpq -c pe" to work from localhost you can add:</p>

[% INCLUDE "join/configuration/restrict-localhost.html" %]

<h4>Setup about 5 servers</h4>

<p>
To work properly ntpd needs to talk to at least 3 servers ("A man with
a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure").
</p>

<p>
For servers in the pool we recommend configuring no less than 4 and no
more than 7 servers.
</p>


<h4>Don't use *.pool.ntp.org servers</h4>

<p>
Ironically to make sure the pool service is the best it can be you
shouldn't use the *.pool.ntp.org aliases in your configuration when
you are going to add your server to the pool.
</p>

<p>
For the robustness of the pool it's healthier if all pool operators "hand pick" good local (network wise) time servers.
The NTP.org wiki has  a <a
href="http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/WebHome">list of public
servers</a>.
</p>


<h4>Use the standard ntpd</h4>

<p>
We are all for software diversity, but a significant percentage of the
"it's not working" questions that come in are for software other than
ntpd.
</p>

<p>
You can <i>use</i> the pool with any program speaking NTP, but if you
are going to join the pool we recommend you
use <a href="http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SoftwareDownloads">ntpd</a>.
</p>


<h4>Don't use the LOCAL clock driver</h4>

<p>Servers in the NTP Pool should not have the LOCAL clock driver
configured.</p>
