<h3>The Score graph</h3>
<p>
A couple of times an hour the pool system checks the time from your
server and compares it to the local time.  Points are deducted if the
server can't be reached or if the time offset is more than 100ms (as
measured relatively crudely from the monitoring systems).  More points
are deducted the bigger the offset is.
</p>

<p>
When the score goes down the background color in the top part of the
chart will reflect how severely the "outage" is.  The color scale goes
from blue (very little) to yellow to orange to red (the server is
several seconds off or unreachable).  Because of how the graph is
averaged out, you can't always infer what happened from the color.
It's only meant as a tool to visualize trends.  For more exact details
of what the monitoring system found you can click on the CSV link.

<h3>The Offset graph</h3>

<p>
The monitoring system works roughly like an <a
href="http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-def.htm#AEN1242">SNTP</a> (<a
href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/database/rfc/rfc2030.txt">RFC
2030</a>) client, so it is more susceptible by random network
latencies between the server and the monitoring system than a regular
ntpd client would be.  In other words: Don't be alarmed by the
occasional large offset and please don't use the offset as an absolute
performance metric.
