	The pool.ntp.org project is a big virtual cluster of timeservers
	providing reliable <a href="use.html">easy to use</a> NTP service
        for millions of	clients.
	</p>
	<p>
	The pool is being used by millions or tens of millions of
	systems around the world.  It's the default "time server" for
	most of the major Linux distributions and many networked appliances
	(see <a href="vendors.html">information for vendors</a>).
	</p>
        <p>
        Because of the large number of users we are in need of more
        servers.  If you have a server with a static IP address always
        available on the internet, please considering <a href="join.html">
        adding it to the system</a>.
        </p>
	<p>
	The project is maintained and developed
	by <a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/">Ask Bj&oslash;rn
	Hansen</a> and a great group of contributors on
	the <a href="/mailinglists.html">mailing lists</a>. The code
	is <a href="http://github.com/abh/ntppool">available</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Hosting and bandwidth for the "hub" servers are currently
        provided by <a href="http://develooper.com/">Develooper</a>,
        <a href="http://www.phyber.com/">Phyber Communications</a> and
        <a href="http://www.yellowbot.com">YellowBot</a>.
