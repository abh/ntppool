	<p>
	If you just want to synchronise your computers clock to the network, the configuration file (for the ntpd program from the <a href="http://www.ntp.org">ntp.org distribution</a>, on any supported operating system - <b>Linux, *BSD, Windows and even some more exotic systems</b>) is really simple:
	</p>

	[% INCLUDE "ntppool/use/sample-config.html" %]

	<p>
	The 0, 1, 2 and 3.pool.ntp.org names point to a random set of servers that will
	change every hour.  Make sure your computer's clock is set to something
	sensible (within a few minutes of the 'true' time) - you could use <code>ntpdate
	pool.ntp.org</code>, or you could just use the <code>date</code> command and set it
	to your wristwatch. Start ntpd, and after some time (this could take as long as
	half an hour!), <code>ntpq -pn</code> should output something like:
	</p>

	[% INCLUDE "ntppool/use/sample-ntpq.html" %]

	<p>
	The IP addresses will be different, because you've been assigned random
	timeservers. The essential thing is that one of the lines starts with an
	asterisk (<code>*</code>), this means your computer gets the time from the internet
	- you'll never have to worry about it again!
	</p>
	<p>
	Looking up <code>pool.ntp.org</code> (or <code>0.pool.ntp.org</code>,
	<code>1.pool.ntp.org</code>, etc) will usually return IP addresses for servers
	in or close to your country. For most users this will give the best results.
	</p>

	<p>You can also use the <a href="/zone/@">continental zones</a> (For example
	<a href="/zone/europe">europe</a>,
	<a href="/zone/north-america">north-america</a>,
	<a href="/zone/oceania">oceania</a>
	or <a href="/zone/asia">asia</a>.pool.ntp.org),
	and a country zone (like
	ch.pool.ntp.org in Switzerland) - for all these zones, you can again use the 0,
	1 or 2 prefixes, like 0.ch.pool.ntp.org.  Note, however, that the country zone
	might not exist for your country, or might contain only one or two timeservers.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you're using <b>a recent Windows version</b>, you can use the ntp
	client that is built into the system. As administrator enter</p>
<pre class="code">
w32tm /config /syncfromflags:manual /manualpeerlist:"0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org 2.pool.ntp.org 3.pool.ntp.org"
</pre>
	<p>
	at the command prompt.  This will work on Windows 2003 and newer.  If you use an
	older version of windows you can try</p>
<pre class="code">
net time /setsntp:"0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org 2.pool.ntp.org"
</pre>
	<p>
	The same can be achieved by, as administrator, right-clicking the clock in the taskbar,
	selecting 'Adjust Date/Time' and entering the server name in the 'Internet Time' tab.
	</p>

	Meinberg made a port of the <a href="http://www.meinberg.de/english/sw/ntp.htm">ntp daemon for windows</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	If your Windows system is part of a domain, you might not be able to independently update your computer time.

	For more information about setting the time on windows, see <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc773013%28WS.10%29.aspx">How Windows Time Service Works</a>.

	<h3 id="notes">Additional Notes</h3>

        <p><span class="hook">Consider if the NTP Pool is appropriate
        for your use</span>. If business, organization or human life
        depends on having correct time or can be harmed by it being
        wrong, you shouldn't "just get it off the internet". The NTP
        Pool is generally very high quality, but it is a service run
        by volunteers in their spare time. Please talk to your
        equipment and service vendors about getting local and reliable
        service setup for you. See also our <a href="/tos.html">terms
        of service</a>.

        We recommend time servers from
        <a href="http://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/products/ntp-time-server.htm">Meinberg</a>,
        but you can also find time servers from
        <a href="http://www.endruntechnologies.com/NTP-Servers/gps-cdma-ntp.htm">End Run</a>,
        <a href="http://spectracom.com/products-services/precision-timing#anchor-2172">Spectracom</a>
        and many others.
        </p>

	<p><span class="hook">If you have a static IP address and a reasonable Internet connection</span> (bandwidth
	is not so important, but it should be stable and not too highly loaded), please
	consider donating your server to the server pool. It doesn't cost you more than
	a few hundred bytes per second traffic, but you help this project survive.
	Please <a href="/join.html">read the joining page</a> for more information.
	</p>

	<p><span class="hook">If your Internet provider has a timeserver</span>, or if you know of a good timeserver
	near you, you should use that and not this list - you'll probably get better
	time and you'll use fewer network resources.  If you know only one timeserver
	near you, you can of course use that and two from pool.ntp.org or so.</p>

	<p><span class="hook">It can rarely happen that you are assigned the same timeserver twice</span> -
	just restarting the ntp server usually solves this problem.  If you
	use a country zone, please note that it may be because there is only
	one server known in the project - better use a continental zone in
	that case.  You can <a href="/zone">browse the zones</a> to see how
	many servers we have in each zone.</p>

	<p><span class="hook">Be friendly</span>. Many servers are provided by volunteers, and almost all time
	servers are really file or mail or webservers which just happen to also run ntp.
	So don't use more than four time servers in your configuration, and don't play
	tricks with <code>burst</code> or <code>minpoll</code> - all you will gain is extra
        load on the volunteer time servers.</p>

	<p><span class="hook">Make sure that the <i>time zone configuration</i> of your computer is correct</span>.
	ntpd itself does not do anything about the time zones, it just uses UTC
	internally.</p>

	<p><span class="hook">If you are synchronising a network to pool.ntp.org</span>, please set up one of your
	computers as a time server and synchronize the other computers to that one.
	(you'll have some reading to do - it's not difficult though. And there's always
	the <a href="news:comp.protocols.time.ntp">comp.protocols.time.ntp newsgroup</a>.)</p>

	<p class="thanks">At this point, I'd like to thank those donating their time and timeservers to
	this network.</p>
