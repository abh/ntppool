<h2>Translators needed!</h2>

<p>
We'd like to make the basic content of the NTP Pool website available
in just about any language; but we need your help!
</p>

<h3>What you'll need</h3>

<p>
<ul>
      <li>Fluent reader of English and fluent in some other language.</li>
      <li>A couple of hours to do the initial translation.</li>
      <li>10-30 minutes about once or twice every 3 months to update the translation with changes.</li>
      <li>Some knowledge of basic HTML.</li>
      <li>Ideally basic familiarity with git or subversion.</li>
      <li>Crazy desire to work for free for no thanks but the benefit of thousands!</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h3>Get started</h3>

<p>
The easiest way to get started is
to <a href="http://github.com/abh/ntppool/zipball/master">download a
zip file</a> or 'clone' the code
with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>.  To use git, start by
creating an account on github and then
clone <a href="http://github.com/abh/ntppool/">the repository</a>.
Either way is helpful, so do whatever is easier for you.
</p>

<p>
Please subscribe to the (very low
traffic) <a href="https://lists.ntp.org/listinfo/pool-i18n">timekeepers-i18n
mailinglist</a>.
</p>


<h3>Do the translation</h3>
<p>
When you have the source code, you will find the strings to translate in two places:

<ul>
<li>.po files in the i18n/ directory.  They can be edited with any
text editor or a dedicated tool, for
example <a href="http://www.poedit.net/">po edit</a>.  If there's no
file for your language you can start one by copying the en.po
file.</li>

<li>Language specific HTML files in the docs/ntppool/ directory.
Start by copying the 'en/' directory.  Only the files in the "language
directory" needs translation.  The rest are either only provided in
English or translated via the .po files.
</li>

</ul>

<p>

<h3>Submit it back</h3>
<p>
When you are done, either zip up your work and tell me the name of the
.zip file you started from or push with git to github
and <a href="mailto:ask@develooper.com">send me a note about it</a>.
