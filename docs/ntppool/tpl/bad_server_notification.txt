Subject: NTP Pool: Problems with your NTP service ([% bad_servers.0.ip %])

Hi [% admin.username || admin.email %],

This is an automated email.

The NTP Pool system has marked your timeserver as either unreachable
or keeping bad time.  Until the issue has been addressed, it will not
be included in the pool.ntp.org DNS zones.

Unless you have questions then you don't need to notify me that the
problem has been resolved; the system will figure that out by itself.
(You can follow the status on the URL listed next to the server IP).
The NTP system is entirely based on IPs, so if the IP changed it will
consider it a new system.  You can schedule this the old IP for
removal and add the new one on the management web site -
http://www.pool.ntp.org/manage

[% FILTER repeat(70) %]-[% END %]
[%- FOR server = bad_servers %]
[% server.ip %] (current score: [% server.score %])  [% config.base_url('ntppool') %]/s/[% server.id %]
[%- END %]
[% FILTER repeat(70) %]-[% END %]

You can see the stats for all your servers in the pool at 
    [% config.base_url('ntppool') %]/manage

If you have any questions, just reply to this email.  Otherwise no
response is necessary.

Thank you for offering your ntp service to the pool!
