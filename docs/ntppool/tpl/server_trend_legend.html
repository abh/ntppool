The history is one entry per check, typically every 30 minutes (left is old values). Legend:</p>
<blockquote class="server_history_legend">
    #: server offset is ok<br />
    x: server offset is tolerable<br />
    o: server offset is too big<br />
    _: server is unreachable<br />
    Hold the cursor over a history entry to see what time it was from in GMT/UTC time.
