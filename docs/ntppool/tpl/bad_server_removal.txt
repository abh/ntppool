Subject: NTP Pool: [% server.ip %] - Your server is being removed from the pool.ntp.org project

Hi [% admin.username || admin.email %],

Due to unresolved problems with your timeserver it is being removed
from the pool.ntp.org project.

Server IP: [% server.ip %][% IF server.hostname %] ([% server.hostname %])[% END %]

The server has been scheduled for removal on [% server.deletion_on.strftime("%B %d, %Y") %].

If you perceive this to be in error (or fixed the server problem) and
want to add the server to the project again, please contact me or go
to [% config.base_url('ntppool') %]/manage to use the automated admin 
interface to cancel the deletion.
