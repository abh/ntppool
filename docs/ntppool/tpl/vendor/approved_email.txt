Hi [% vz.user.name %],

[% END %]


Please subscribe to the (announce-only, very low traffic)
ntppool-vendors list at Google Groups.  We recommend everyone in your
organization involved with this is subscribed there.
   http://groups.google.com/group/ntppool-vendors

If you are a commercial organization/product/company consider
contributing back to the pool so we can keep the service sustainable
even with the commercial usage:
    http://www.pool.ntp.org/vendors/contribute.html

If you do not, you seriously diminish the chances that we can continue
to offer this service to you.



Kind regards,
