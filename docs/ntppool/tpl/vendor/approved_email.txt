Hi [% vz.user.name %],

Your vendor pool zone "[% vz.zone_name %]" has been setup.  The
hostnames are below.  They will be active within a few hours.

[%- FOR i = [0..3] -%]
   [% i %].[% vz.zone_name %].pool.ntp.org
[% END %]

Please consider contributing back to the pool so we can keep the
service sustainable even with the commercial usage: 
    http://www.pool.ntp.org/vendors/contribute.html

If you do not, you seriously diminish the chances that we can continue
to offer this service.

Also - please subscribe to the (announce-only, very low traffic)
ntppool-vendors list at Google Groups.  We recommend everyone in your
organization involved with this is subscribed there.
