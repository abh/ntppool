	<h1>NTP Pool DNS servers</h1>

<p>
To direct our millions of NTP users to an appropriate server we run a
customized DNS server.  Many of the instances are offered by
volunteers around the world.  This page provides more information if
you are interested in providing a (virtual) server to be used for DNS
services.
</p>

<h2>Requirements for hosting a server</h2>

<p>
The NTP Pool DNS server usually runs on CentOS or Ubuntu LTS; either
will work though Ubuntu LTS is preferred.  We also have one instance
running on FreeBSD (in a jail I believe) which is performing very very well,
but our automation setup isn't as robust for configuring it.
</p>

<p>

If it's a virtual machine it needs to be something like KVM or BHyve
based, not a "kernel container based" system (basically our setup
process needs full root access to a kernel).
</p>

<p>
    <dl>

    <dt>Operating System</dt>
    <dd>
        Basically just a minimal-ish install of (64-bit, x86_64) CentOS or
        Ubuntu LTS.  Our software also works with FreeBSD, but we
        prefer not maintaining the base system on other operating
        systems than Ubunutu and CentOS, so if the system runs FreeBSD
        we prefer just getting a jail on a well maintained system.
    </dd>

    <dt>CPU</dt>

    <dd>Almost any two core 64-bit CPU from the last 4-5 years will do a nice job
    </dd>

    <dt>RAM</dt>
    <dd>Minimum 1GB, ideally 2-4GB to ease system maintenance tasks.
    </dd>

    <dt>Disk space</dt>
    <dd>
        6-8GB or more, again mostly to allow for system updates etc. It
        can be just about as slow as you can imagine and it'll be
        fine.
    </dd>

    <dt>IP addresses</dt>
    <dd>
        One routable IPv4 address, ideally also IPv6. If your
        network supports us announcing our anycast network then we like doing that,
        see below for BGP information.
    </dd>

    <dt>Bandwidth</dt>
    <dd>
        It used to be less, currently it's about 5-10Mbit/second per server (anywhere
        from 1-2TB data per month).
        <br><br>
        During certain times of the hour and the day the rate goes up significantly
        for a few seconds. If you are in a country with poor DNS server coverage
        but can't serve that many requests, we have tools to give you less traffic.
    </dd>

    <dt>Software</dt>
    <dd>
        Regular DNS servers can't smartly respond with a "nearby" server out of
        several thousand and do so weighted, so we run a bit of <a href="https://geo.bitnames.com/">
        quirky DNS software</a> that can.
    </dd>

    <!--
    <dt>BGP access</dt>
    <dd>(only for anycast nodes) The NTP Pool DNS anycast AS number is
        6647. It will be announced with the 'bird' daemon or with
        exabgp.  The IPv4 prefix is 207.171.17.0/24. If you have IPv6,
        then we'll also announce 2620:101:d007::/48.
    </dd>
    -->

    <dt>Firewall/security</dt>
    <dd>
      No external firewall is needed, but in case you operate one:

        <ol>
        <li>port 53 (UDP and TCP)</li>
        <li>port 22 (ssh)</li>
        <li>port 8052 and 8053 (mTLS authenticated monitoring)</li>
        <li>port 179 (for optional bgp setups)</li>
        </ol>
        Be sure to disable session tracking for port 53/udp if you do have a firewall.
    </dd>

    <dt>Management</dt>
    <dd>
        We typically do the day-to-day management of the system.
    </dd>
