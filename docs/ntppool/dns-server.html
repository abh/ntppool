	<h1>NTP Pool DNS servers</h1>

<p>
To direct our millions of NTP users to an appropriate server we run a
customized DNS server.  Many of the instances are offered by
volunteers around the world.  This page provides more information if
you are interested in providing a (virtual) server to be used for DNS
services.
</p>

<h3>Experimental appliance</h3>
<p>
The production servers run on setups as described below, though we've
also started testing an "appliance" that can run in a virtual machine
or from a USB stick or compact flash with minimal setup. If you are
able and interested in helping us test this,
please <a href="https://github.com/abh/pgeodns/wiki/Appliance">see the
pgeodns wiki</a>.
</p>

<h2>Requirements for hosting a server</h2>

<p>
The NTP Pool DNS server usually runs on CentOS or Ubuntu LTS; either
will work though CentOS is preferred.  We also have one instance
running on FreeBSD (in a jail I believe) which is performing very very well.
</p>

<p>
If it's a virtual machine, it needs to be a Xen or KVM based one if
the server is going to be part of
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast">anycast</a> setup.
The "container" systems (OpenVZ) don't have the required network
interfaces to work. VMware will probably work, too.
</p>

    <dl>

    <dt>Operating System</dt>
    <dd>
        Basically just a minimal-ish install of (64-bit, x86_64) CentOS or
        Ubuntu LTS.  Our software also works with FreeBSD, but we
        prefer not maintaining the base system on other operating
        systems than Ubunutu and CentOS, so if the system runs FreeBSD
        we prefer just getting a jail on a well maintained system.
        We can also run on Mac OS X 10.6+, but again someone else
        should apply system updates etc in that case.
    </dd>

    <dt>CPU</dt>

    <dd>Faster is better. About 2 CPU cores, in the ballpark of 2GHz
    or faster is best. Almost any CPU from the last 4-5
    years will do a nice job, though it has to be a 64-bit system.
    </dd>

    <dt>RAM</dt>
    <dd>1GB is comfortable, less is okay but not less than 512MB.
    </dd>

    <dt>Disk space</dt>
    <dd>
        4-5GB is plenty. It can be just about as slow as you can imagine and it'll be fine.
    </dd>

    <dt>IP addresses</dt>
    <dd>
        One routable IPv4 address. IPv6 is also nice, but not required. If your
        network supports us announcing our anycast network then we like doing that,
        see below for BGP information.
    </dd>

    <dt>Bandwidth</dt>
    <dd>
        It used to be less, currently it's about 1-5Mbit/second per server (anywhere
        from 100-500GB data per month).
        <br><br>
        During certain times of the hour and the day the rate goes up significantly
        for a few seconds (basically to however many the CPU and the software
        can keep up with). If you are in a country with poor DNS server coverage
        but can't serve that many requests, we have tools to give you less traffic.
    </dd>

    <dt>Software</dt>
    <dd>
        Regular DNS servers can't smartly respond with a "nearby" server out of
        several thousand and do so weighted, so we run a bit of <a href="http://geo.bitnames.com/">
        quirky DNS software</a> that can.
    </dd>

    <dt>BGP access</dt>
    <dd>(only for anycast nodes) The NTP Pool DNS anycast AS number is
        6647. It will be announced with the 'bird' daemon or with
        exabgp.  The IPv4 prefix is 207.171.17.0/24. If you have IPv6,
        then we'll also announce 2620:101:d007::/48.
    </dd>

    <dt>Firewall/security</dt>
    <dd>
        The system needs incoming port 53 (duh), port 22
        (or another port for ssh if you so require) and obviously port 179 to
        your routers for BGP.  (No external firewall is needed, just in case
        you have one and it needs holes opened up.  Be sure to disable session
        tracking for port 53/udp if you do have a firewall).
    </dd>

    <dt>Management</dt>
    <dd>
        We typically do the day-to-day management of the system.
    </dd>
