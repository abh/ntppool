        <h3>Monitor setup</h3>

        <p>
            The NTP Pool's monitoring infrastructure relies on
            dedicated volunteers from our community who run
            monitoring agents around the world. To ensure system
            reliability and maintain balanced coverage, our
            monitoring program operates by invitation only. If
            you're an active participant in the NTP Pool
            community, you can learn more about contributing
            through discussions at
            <a href="https://community.ntppool.org">
                community.ntppool.org
            </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To install the monitoring agent, add the
            <a href="https://builds.ntppool.dev/repo/">
                yum/dnf or apt/dpkg repository</a> and install
            the <code>ntppool-agent</code> package.
        </p>

        <p>
            Further instructions can be found in the
            (invitation-only) monitoring category on
            the community site.
