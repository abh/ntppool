		<p>
		<a name="netspeed"></a>The <b>net speed</b> is used to balance the
		load between the pool servers. If your server can handle more or you'd
		like less NTP requests, you can adjust this value. The query load to
		your IP should adjust within 10-30 minutes.<br>
		This speed does not mean the wire speed of your server, it's just a relative
		value to other servers.
		</p>

		<p>
		The amount of queries your server will get is
		generally directly proportional to the netspeed, so a
		50Mbit setting will get about 5 times more traffic
		than the 10Mbit setting. Be aware that the
		amount of queries to your server will grow over time.
		</p>

		<p>
		The "availability <b>score</b>" goes up to 20. It
		must be higher than 10 for the server to be included in
		the cluster.
		</p>

		<p>As noted on the <a href="[% combust.www_url("/join.html") %]">join information</a> page adding
		your IP to the pool is a long term commitment.  If you need to remove
		your server from the pool you can schedule the removal with the
		<b>delete</b> button (up to 3 months in advance!).
