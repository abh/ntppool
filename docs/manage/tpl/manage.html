		<a name="netspeed"></a>The <b>net speed</b> is used to balance the
		load between the pool servers.  If your connection is asymmetric
		(like most DSL connections) you should use the <i>lower</i> speed.
		</p>

		<p>
		The amount of queries your server will get is
		generally directly proportional to the netspeed, so a
		50Mbit setting will get about 5 times more traffic
		than the 10Mbit setting. The pool will only use a
		fraction of the "netspeed setting".  Be aware that the
		amount of queries to your server will grow over time.
		</p>

		<p>
		The "availability <b>score</b>" goes up to 20.  It
		must be higher than 10 for the server to be included in
		the cluster.
		</p>

		<p>As noted on the <a href="[% combust.www_url("/join.html") %]">join information</a> page adding
		your IP to the pool is a long term commitment.  If you need to remove
		your server from the pool you can schedule the removal with the
		<b>delete</b> button (up to 3 months in advance!).
