Hi [% vz.user.name %],

Your vendor pool zone "[% vz.zone_name %]" has been setup.  The
hostnames are below.  They will be active within a few hours.

[%- FOR i = [0..3] -%]
   [% i %].[% vz.zone_name %].pool.ntp.org
[% END %]

Please subscribe to the (announce-only, very low traffic - typically a
few mails a year or less) vendor information mailing list. We
recommend everyone in your organization involved with project are
subscribed: http://www.ntppool.org/vendors/list

If you are a commercial organization/product/company consider
contributing back to the pool so we can keep the service sustainable
even with the commercial usage:
    http://www.pool.ntp.org/vendors/contribute.html

If you do not, you seriously diminish the chances that we can continue
to offer this service to you.



Kind regards,

Ask Bjørn Hansen
